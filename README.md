## Sylvia's Super-Awesome DML Demo 2012!

_Super-Awesome Sylvia came up with the idea and TechNinja coded it: It's our crazy _[Digital Media & Learning][1]_ conference Science Fair demo!_

**The Setup:** Up to three participants line up in front of the booth table and watch the TV in front of them. Each has their own "control panel" with a button and a lump of home-made conductive salt dough on two copper pads connected to an Ethernet enabled Arduino.

**The Gimmick:** Each player controls a spaceship on screen by squishing the dough in _just the right way_, and the first player across the finish line on the right side of the screen, wins! Exactly how to squish the dough isn't given, and you can't simply squish it flat; the ships only move if there's enough change in the dough's resistance over time. Also the space field players must cross is randomly strewn with hurtling 3D asteroids that they can deflect with their laser, if they can react in time!
